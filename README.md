# Text Editor

This is a terminal based text editor written in C. You can open and edit any text file in it. Apart from the arrow keys, it also recognizes page up, page down, home, and end keys for an ergonomic experience. It also lets the user search for a particular text in a file and navigate through the results using arrow keys.  

## How to use

1. To open a file:
    ```shell 
    $ .\editor <filename>
    ```
2. Press ctrl + s to save any changes.
3. Press ctrl + q to quit. 

## TODO

1. Syntax Highlighting
2. Parallelize for performance

## Note for Mac users

1. For page up/down, use fn + opt + up/down arrow key.
2. For home/end key, use fn + left/right arrow key.
